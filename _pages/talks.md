_Privacy Perceptions and Needs of Bystanders of Smart Devices_

, in our initial work [1], our goal was to understand bystanders’privacy perceptions, their privacy needs, and their current privacy enhancing behaviors aroundsmart devices. We conducted a semi-structured interview study with 19 participants to uncovertheir perceptions of privacy and their privacy enhancing behaviors. Participants were shownand allowed to interact with two smart devices equipped with both audio and video recordingsensors: the Nest indoor camera and the Amazon Echo Show. The findings uncover the needs forunambiguous privacy notices and hardware-based control mechanisms in smart devices. Based onour qualitative findings, we identify and define ‘tangible privacy’ mechanisms as those privacycontrol and feedback mechanisms that are ‘tangible’, i.e., manipulated or perceived by touch, and of‘high assurance’, i.e., they provide clear confidence and certainty of privacy to observers. Cameralens caps and the common use of stickers on laptop cameras are examples of tangible privacymechanisms. On the other hand, an LED indicator is not (since it lacks the certainty providedby a lens cap: users may worry the camera could still be recording with the LED off). We alsoproposed several design recommendations for smart devices’ sensors (e.g., camera, microphone)that align with the properties of our proposed tangible privacy mechanisms. Further, our findingsshowed that people do not trust software-based control mechanisms mainly because these can beeasily compromised by adversaries and these mechanisms do not provide them with a sense ofempowerment and control over the device. Our study showed how peoples’ privacy enhancingbehaviors around smart devices closely follow controlling mechanisms that people apply to regulatetheir boundary in interaction with real people in a social setting as outlined by Altman’s theoryof Privacy Regulation [2] and privacy theories like Nissenbaum’s Contextual Integrity [9] canplay important roles in designing sensors that can assure users of their privacy. To sum up, ourstudy provided strong evidence that people prefer hardware based controlling mechanisms that are integrated on the device itself and are tangible in nature. They also want privacy notices that areeasy to interpret and clearly communicate the device’s actual state to everyone in the vicinity ofthe device.

_Evaluating Tangible Privacy Mechanisms for Protecting Bystander Privacy_

The previous study revealed that bystanders show a clear preference towards privacy control andfeedback mechanisms that can be manipulated physically. Moreover, they want privacy notices thatenable them to perceive their action and the system’s output simultaneously. Our first study alsoshowed that though participants considered both camera and microphone sensors to be similarlyprivacy invasive, they found it comparatively harder to maintain their privacy around microphonesthan cameras. Thus, as a next step, in our current study, we have designed six prototypical voiceassistants by varying the types of control mechanism (physical control, software control) andfeedback mechanism (physical feedback, software feedback, LED-based feedback) and evaluatedparticipants’ perceived reliability, perceived risk, propensity to trust, and perceived control onthese prototypes. We also evaluated their perceived usability of these prototypes. The differenttypes of control and feedback mechanisms were designed based on the property of ‘tangibility’– asidentified in our first study and a property sought out for providing better control and assurancein other contexts [10]. We conducted a between-subject online survey with participants who hadprior experience of using smart voice assistants. We presented them with scenarios where theyneed to consider themselves as visitors. We have conducted quantitative analysis to understandhow different combinations of control and feedback mechanisms influence participants’ ratings ofthe above mentioned variables. Overall, currently, our findings show that users prefer on-devicehardware-based control, they find hardware-based controls more reliable and usable comparedto software based control mechanisms. Moreover, for privacy notices, they mostly prefer LEDbased notifications compared to both hardware based and software based notifications. Thus, moreresearches need to be done to explore reliable, on-device, hardware-based disconnects that alsogives usable and reliable hardware based notifications to bystanders of smart voice assistants

_Modeling sparsity of planar topologies for wireless multi-hop networks_

![](https://github.com/Imtiazborshon/imtiaz.github.io/blob/master/images/wiopt.png)

In this project, we provide a generic analytical model for evaluating sparseness of planar topologies for wireless networks. We derive an analytical expressions that can be used in determining average node degree and the topology size without running simulations or prior to the deployment of real systems.
