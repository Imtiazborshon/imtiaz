<font size="5"> <i> <b>Privacy Perceptions and Needs of Bystanders of Smart Devices </b></i> </font>

In this project, we investigate how bystanders interact with smart internet connected devices (e.g., Nest Camera, Amazon Echo Show). Through a semi-structured interview study we uncover bystanders' privacy perceptions, their privacy needs, and their current privacy enhancing behaviors around smart devices. The findings uncover the needs for unambiguous privacy notices and hardware-based control mechanisms in smart devices. Based on our qualitative analysis, we identify and define 'tangible privacy' mechanisms as those privacy control and feedback mechanisms that are 'tangible', i.e., manipulated or perceived by touch, and of 'high assurance', i.e., they provide clear confidence and certainty of privacy to observers. Overall, our study provided evidence that people prefer hardware based tangible control and feedback mechanisms. They also want privacy notices that are easy to interpret and clearly communicate the device's actual state to everyone in the vicinity of the device.

**Method**: Contextual interviews, Qualitative analysis

<font size="5"> <i> <b>Evaluating Tangible Privacy Mechanisms for Protecting Bystander Privacy </b></i> </font>

The previous study revealed that bystanders show a clear preference towards privacy control andfeedback mechanisms that can be manipulated physically. Moreover, they want privacy notices thatenable them to perceive their action and the system’s output simultaneously. Our first study alsoshowed that though participants considered both camera and microphone sensors to be similarlyprivacy invasive, they found it comparatively harder to maintain their privacy around microphonesthan cameras. Thus, as a next step, in our current study, we have designed six prototypical voiceassistants by varying the types of control mechanism (physical control, software control) andfeedback mechanism (physical feedback, software feedback, LED-based feedback) and evaluatedparticipants’ perceived reliability, perceived risk, propensity to trust, and perceived control onthese prototypes. We also evaluated their perceived usability of these prototypes. The differenttypes of control and feedback mechanisms were designed based on the property of ‘tangibility’– asidentified in our first study and a property sought out for providing better control and assurancein other contexts [10]. We conducted a between-subject online survey with participants who hadprior experience of using smart voice assistants. We presented them with scenarios where theyneed to consider themselves as visitors. We have conducted quantitative analysis to understandhow different combinations of control and feedback mechanisms influence participants’ ratings ofthe above mentioned variables. Overall, currently, our findings show that users prefer on-devicehardware-based control, they find hardware-based controls more reliable and usable comparedto software based control mechanisms. Moreover, for privacy notices, they mostly prefer LEDbased notifications compared to both hardware based and software based notifications. Thus, moreresearches need to be done to explore reliable, on-device, hardware-based disconnects that alsogives usable and reliable hardware based notifications to bystanders of smart voice assistants

In this project, we provide a generic analytical model for evaluating sparseness of planar topologies for wireless networks. We derive an analytical expressions that can be used in determining average node degree and the topology size without running simulations or prior to the deployment of real systems.
